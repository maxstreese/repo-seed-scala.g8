## Description

The [Giter8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) template I use for bootstrapping basic Scala repositories/projects.
As this template is for my personal use it is tailored to whatever repository structure and Scala style I happen to
be using. That being said if someone finds this repository helpful feel free to utilize it in whichever way you like
(also see the [license](license)).

## Usage

With the Giter8 command line tool:
```bash
g8 maxstreese/repo-seed-scala.g8
```

With SBT:
```bash
sbt new maxstreese/repo-seed-scala.g8
```
